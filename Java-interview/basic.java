1. JDK, JRE, JVM:
    JDK: JRE + other tools(etc. compiler: convert java codes to byte codes)
    JRE: JVM + class libraries + other supporting files
    JVM: provide platform-indedepend way of executing source codes; it converts the byte codes to machine codes

    yes, but only public static void main(String[] args) will be launched by JVM
